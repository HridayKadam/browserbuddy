This Chrome extension will temporarily block access to distracting websites while you're in focus mode. Here's how it works:

### Features:
- **Toggle Focus Mode**: Enable/disable blocking with one click
- **Timer Function**: Set a focus session duration (25 minutes by default)
- **Default Blocklist**: Comes with commonly distracting sites pre-loaded
- **Customize Sites**: Add or remove websites from your blocklist
- **Gentle Blocking**: Shows an overlay with a 5-second cooldown before allowing access
