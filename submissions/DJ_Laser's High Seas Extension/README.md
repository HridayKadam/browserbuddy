## Build Manually

Use the included nix flake by running `nix develop` (or manually install nodejs 22)

Install packages with `npm i --force` (`--force` is needed because `@hackclub/icons` does officially not support react 19)

Build for chrome or firefox with `npm run build` or `npm run build-ff` respectively
