Hi! This is my extension called Annotator. It's a simple tool to highlight text and add your own notes to websites. It's useful when making a research for an essay or any other project.
I didn't test it on Firefox yet, only on Chrome. The extension was tested by 3 people (incl. me) and nobody reported any problems with it.

This extension took me 6 hours to make + abt. 1 hour to make a logo for it.

This extension was made with a bit of help of GitHub Copilot as I was just learning how to make one :)
