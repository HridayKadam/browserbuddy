# Slate AI browser extension

## The problem and the solution

Have you ever found yourself sitting on piles of random webpages, trying to curate your research, only to get lost? Or see something on the internet that you want to save, along with a "note to self"?

- Slate AI makes surfing the internet so much easier. A handy, small button accompanies you on the top right of webpages. 
- When you see something you want to save, select desired text on the page and click on the button, or simply save the entire page!
- When you save the page/text, you can add a note for youself.
- In the popup of the extension, you can have quick access to everything you've saved, summarised by AI.
- When you save a page/note to yourself, the AI can look for important dates and alarms, and a reminder will automatically pop up at the right time, along with the title!
- The entire extension is incredibly easy-to-use and simple, with no need to lift a finger for smart reminders and alarms, and easy access to saved pages' content.

## Usage
- Usage is straightforward; click on the button to save the entire page, or select text before clicking the button to save some particular text.
- Optionally, add a note when prompted.
- AI sets alarms and calendars for you, based on the text and your note.
- Open the extension popup to access your information and popup.
