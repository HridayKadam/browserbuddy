A browser extension that grades your chess games from their PGN notation.

## How it works.
This app utilises [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org) chess engine that grades positions based on the Eval system. This app grades the difference between the eval values and uses a top-notch algorithm to grade moves into 6 categories ranked best to worst:-

- best_move
- book_move
- excellent_move
- good_move
- inaccuracy
- mistake
- blunder

## Installation
You can install chessbro via chrome webstore in the future. However, for now you can load an unpacked extension into your browser.


### Game Review - Usage

Copy and paste your chess game's PGN file and hit analyse.
